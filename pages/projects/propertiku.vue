With comprehensive search filters, detailed information, and an interactive map, Propertiku ensures that you can quickly and easily find the right property to suit your needs."
      roleProject="My role in this project is as a product designer. I work independently on this project."
      problemProject="Searching for the right property often takes time and can be confusing, with information scattered across various platforms and difficult to access. This manual process is inefficient, causing potential buyers or renters to miss out on the best opportunities and face difficulties in comparing available options. Therefore, a real estate search application is needed that can gather, filter, and display property information in a centralized and user-friendly manner, making it easier for users to quickly and efficiently find properties that meet their needs."
