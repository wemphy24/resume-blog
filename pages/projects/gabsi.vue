      introProject="Porprov Admin is an information system created to facilitate the conduct of the East Java Provincial Sports Week (Porprov) for the Bridge sports category. With this system, the committee will find it easy to manage and distribute information related to the competition, such as match schedules, medal standings, and regulations to participants and spectators alike. With this web-based system, information will be easily accessible to anyone visiting the website."
      roleProject="My role in this project is as system analyst and also fullstack developer."
      problemProject="Information regarding Bridge matches disseminated through WhatsApp groups easily gets lost in discussions, making it difficult for group members to find it again. There is a lack of centralized information, causing new participants to be unsure where to find information about match scores, winners, and medal achievements. Match data is only stored locally by the organizers, making it difficult for spectators or participants to access the information later, resulting in inefficient data storage."
